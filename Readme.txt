Mess Food Management System(Soul Food):-


Overview:- 
Quite often it so happens that our tummies and the menu of our hostel mess have a conflict of interest. As a result, we either opt for the canteen to fill our bellies or 
make plans for treats. But the mess administration is quite unaware of this which costs a significant amount of food wastage in mess.

The purpose of this Android Application is to reduce food wastage. In many messes, there is no facility to see the menu and then mark their attendance according to 
their choice which will reduce food wastage. This app is mainly designed for Banasthali students to get the information about the meal just at a click with alot of other 
features.
